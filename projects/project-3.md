summary: An implementation of Minesweeper I made for ICS 211
---

This was the final project for ICS211 which we implemented using Java's swing and awt libraries. In the game, the player had the freedom to choose what difficulty they played on and see the high scores, much like the version of Minesweeper probably on your computer.

This was a two-person group assignment that, much to my misfortune, my partner had stopped showing up halfway through. Unfortunately, I do not have the source code anymore, but I had created custom artwork for the game, and created a 1000+ line program within a week (I procrastinated on this).

By the end, I had learned a couple of things that stick to me this day:
1. Procrastinating a project until a week before its due was probably the biggest mistake I've made in the ICS program.
2. If the whole partner situation happens again, I will be more assertive in trying to get a replacement/extension.

Finishing a game that I was satisfied with really resonated with me; I had never really felt that sense of accomplishment at the time and that was probably the first.
