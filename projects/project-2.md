The bank database program I created was a project I made in ICS 212, and it taught me how to weave multiple files and classes in C++.

Bank User Database uses C++ as mentioned, and provides an interface for the user to basically create and modify account data. Account data would be credentials provided by the user, such as name, account numbers, addresses. The user could also print out data and manipulate the data.

This project taught me to understand how to manipulate linked links with much further depth and object-oriented programming.
