Slippah is an interactive quiz tool that implemented the parWinr interface, which was created by the professor of the class, Jan Stelovsky. The quiz tool creates an interactive platform for students to personalize and get creative with the material being taught. The students would then exchange quizzes within groups to complete by the next class.

Incorporating the tool used a json file, provided by Dr. Stelovsky, which preloaded a template with a provided video of the lecture to base our quizzes on. When the quizzes were finished, we imported it into a HTML file, which there was the option to just paste the video code into a 1-liner or personalize the page.

Although very simple, the process of creating quizzes and thinking of thoughtful questions for the quiz really got you to really brainstorm and constantly tell yourself, "Is this question too easy? Is it even worth asking?" The meticulous process of making quizzes and taking other quizzes really got students to engage themselves into the course.
