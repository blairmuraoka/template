	Have you ever made a choice and believed truly there would be little or no consequences at all? Sure, maybe sometimes it really has no consequences. Unfortunately, there are the times that it does have repercussions and that's all that matters, no matter how unlikely. In fact, the work we do as software engineers is more likely to encounter such problems (since technology is hot), and that is why we must follow a set of rules to help keep us on the right path without harm.

	When you think of wrongdoing or whats unethical in the software engineering world, you would think that someone had stole someone's work and played it off as their own, or hacked into some system, or even just not being compliant with standards. It only comes into light when something terrible happens when you realize that what you have worked on, despite following all standards and being all-original, may have been unethical. And thats exactly what happens to Bill Sourour, described in his short "The code I’m still ashamed of".

<h3>The code I’m still ashamed of</h3>
<p>
	In Sourour's "<a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e">The code I’m still ashamed of</a>", he is given a task which involves making a rigged survey to almost always recommend the product (in this case a drug) to those who took it, unless they had allergies. You can already see that this is using his skills to recommend something to someone regardless of whether they needed it, and in the case of drugs, this is a very dangerous thing to be doing. Sourour is somewhat aware of what's wrong with this, but still decides to do it because he thought marketing would handle it and he was making money. I don't think Sourour is a terrible person because he was young and just doing his job, but it was technically unethical as it does pose a risk to the general public. Much to his surprise, he later learns that a girl has committed suicide due to a side effect of the drug he had made the site for. It is not explicitly stated that she took that survey, but it seems to be heavily implied. This is a harsh way to learn that it is important to live and work with morals and ethically because the smallest thing you do could have the greatest impact on your life.
