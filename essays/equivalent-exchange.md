When asking a question, it's hard to think that you're ever doing the person or community you are asking any favors, just being needy. In most cases, that is usually true. However, thought-provoking questions may appeal to those programmers who get off on these type of questions, although a very select few. Smart questions birth beautiful answers, which in turn breeds smart programmers, in which they will continue the cycle of discovering new answers to many new smart questions. On a more serious note, smart questions usually give the community an easier time with what you truly want to know, and sometimes engages them to have to think hard to come up with a solution. Because in this world, sometimes coming up with a solution is beneficial to themselves and not just for the reputation.

<h2>The Smart Way</h2>
In <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46078230/why-does-the-symantec-csr-checker-think-my-csr-is-missing-a-null-value-in-algori">this question</a>, the enquirer asks his question about how he is supposedly missing something in his work even though he is sure it is there. A couple things to note on why this question qualify as a "smart" question are:
<ul><li>His title is very descriptive on what his problem is and what he is working with and includes where he is basing his work from.

<li>He drops a snippit of his code where he thinks the problem is located, and the output he is getting.

<li>He explains the problems symptoms clearly, and leaves his guesses to himself unless asked otherwise.</ul>
I could drone on and pinpoint most of the points made on the <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How to ask questions the smart way page</a>, but I'm going to just say this guy asked his question satisfactorily. What I'd like to point out is that -we'll say Banna for the sake of acknowledging his question was done right- Banna had received an answer within hours of the ask time not only because his question was asked appropriately, but the fact that Banna had actively replied with the contributors his thoughts and actions taken based on what they had said. When Banna got the answer he was looking for, he thanks the contributor with enthusiasm and gives a summary of what was wrong to confirm with the contributors. This right here shows that a simple "thanks" doesn't convey as much appreciation to the contributor who had helped with the solution.

<h2>The Not-so-smart way</h2>

When I wanted to convey an example for this, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46108292/urgent-answer-needed-about-sql">I wanted it to be absolutely terrible</a>. It took me about 30 minutes to find it, but I think it's worth it.

Let's start with the title:
<blockquote>Urgent answer needed about sql</blockquote>
...Even if you didn't get a chance to read the reference, I think its clear (not his title) that his title has no redeeming features. Therefore, who would even click that link to begin with? Besides people like myself purposely searching for something like this, nobody.

Lets look at the first sentence now:
<blockquote>There r two tables emp and dept.</blockquote>
If I were an established developer and even gave this a chance to begin with, CTRL-W.

Moving on from criticising almost every part of his question, his objective was to seek a quick answer just to move on from this entirely. He wasn't trying to learn, nor will he with this question. If anyone gave him a satisfactory answer, he might just come back with another ignorant question expecting an answer. 

Upon receiving a possible answer, he doesn't really show any improvement in his attitude and instead states that there was another requirement that he didn't mention in the original post. He then proceeds to double reply, almost begging for help.

<h2>Summary</h2>
The overall quality and quantity of contributions you will receive will reflect on how well your question was asked. If you did it elegantly like Banna, you'll be done and have learned something. If you're putting the word "Urgent" in your title, chances are you won't be getting it "urgently", or at all, even.
