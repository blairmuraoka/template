	Bootstrap. That's the first thing I thought of when I started the UI Frameworks module. I only had a bit of understanding of HTML and CSS when I started and never bothered to learn about different frameworks, although I know pretty much every website uses one. 
</p>

<h2>Semantic UI</h2>
<div>

<p>
	Enter <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a>, a framework I only knew as a Bootstrap alternative. Initially, I expected to be working with Bootstrap and was looking forward to it as I've put off learning it for quite a while. So when I finally decided to look at the module for the week and saw Semantic UI, I was a little disappointed. I've never heard of it and immediately thought of it as a knock-off Bootstrap, <i>this should be fun <small>(/sarcasm)</small></i>. In the week that followed, I developed a love-hate relationship with this framework and although I don't hold the same contempt for it as I originally had, it made me curious to know the difference between the two frameworks.

<h2>BrowserHistory - Reimplementation</h2>
<p>
	The first task with Semantic UI was a demonstration of how just implementing the framework and changing a few lines could change our page. Admittingly, I was elated when I saw our crappy BrowserHistory page transform into something a little easier on the eyes. But at this point, I really had no idea of what I was doing; I was just implementing some of the features without understanding it.
</p>

<h2>IslandSnow - Reimplementation</h2>
<p>
	My skills with Semantic UI were put to a test when attempting to do the reimplementation of the <a href="https://islandsnow.com/">IslandSnow</a> website. Although simple, trying to complete with task within a certain time really put some pressure on me, especially when I'm trying to scan the documentation for what I needed. During this task, I realized that I would certainly need to read up on the documentation so I don't have to keep looking at it.
</p>

<h2>MangaStream - Your Choice</h2>
<div>

<p>
	The final task was to clone a <a href="http://mangastream.com/">website of our choice</a> using the framework, given that the website didn't already use Semantic UI. This wasn't timed, but it was no easy task for me. Sure, I had read up on the documentation, but during the process, I had to learn how different elements would interact with other elements, and the documentation doesn't provide an answer for everything. I had to really look into why this element wasn't behaving the way I said I wanted it to and the whole debugging process drove me insane. However, as things started to make more sense and came together, it became a lot easier to figure out what elements I would need to use. I started thinking in a structural sense after a few hours of trying to make things work because the documentation said it would. Before I knew it, I was done and that feeling of closing your IDE knowing you've done a good-enough job is just pure ecstasy. I say good-enough because some things that I did using some CSS tricks and not Semantic UI because I didn't know (text over a photo and transparent background).

<h2>Hard Rock Cafe - In-class WOD</h2>
<p>
  The WOD for the class was to implement a simplified version of the <a href="http://www.hardrock.com/cafes/honolulu/">Hard Rock Cafe</a> front page, which was identical to the IslandSnow WOD in the sense that the elements we cloned were practically the same. The navbar, the fluid image and the footer followed the same skeletal structure the practice WOD had and because of that, it was fairly simple. Although I took about 30 minutes to finish it, I would like to say that I <i>really</i> took my sweet time doing it. I spent a fairly long amount of time deleting the same lines over and over as I was sitting there with my mind blank, not because I was stuck somewhere, but actually just pondering on who knows what. In the end, I finished within the timer with confidence in my work, but a little disappointed as it was a really simple task that took me 30 minutes.
</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
	So, although this whole segment might've been the most frustrating of ICS 314 so far, I feel like I learned a lot more about UI Frameworks. Currently, I don't know how I feel about Semantic UI besides mild contempt. I can't compare it to BootStrap as I haven't played with it yet, but having a better understanding of the frameworks, I may start trying out the same implementations as in this module with that.
