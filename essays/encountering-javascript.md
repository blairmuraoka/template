<h2>Introduction to JS</h2>When I started the JavaScript tutorial, I initially thought, “this is literally Java, so what’s different?” What I found was that JavaScript seemed to me like if C and Java had a lovechild, you’d get JavaScript. That sounds like something Ravi<sub>1</sub> would say. However, I’m probably wrong about this as I have just started.<br><br>
JavaScript seems like a very simple version of the languages I have been using in my first year (C and Java), and I can’t really say whether or not I like it. For example, not really having to declare primitives like int or char. I really like this part of JavaScript because it’s really simple, but at the same time, I feel like I will have to be writing in more comments if I want readability, mainly for debugging.

<h2>Workout of the Day</h2>
Workouts of the Day, or WODs, is basically a quiz, but with coding. There’s a problem, you only get so much time, and you get a grade based on what you submit. The thing that makes them unique is that they test you on two things, one being how well you know the language, and two being how long does it take for you to find the algorithm you need. This is where the stress comes in because coming into class, you need keep in mind that you’ll need to know what new functions were gone over, but also that the prompt could be anything. The practice WODs provided before the actual WOD are very helpful as they get you into shape (that’s why it’s called a workout!) with handling the stress of a quiz. 
<br><br>
The first WOD was simple, but coming into the class, I wasn’t fully composed. I kept thinking to myself, “What if I finish last? Don’t finish last.” No one really wants to be the last one, and I’m not calling out the last person because everyone goes at their own rate, but my competitive nature drives my motivation. 

<h2>Summary</h2>
Overall, JavaScript is something I won't decide to hate just yet, but I like its simplicity for now. 
As for the WODs, I think I liked the it? It might work for me? I also might end up loathing them, so time will tell.
