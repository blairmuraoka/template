Beyond the trivial aspects of coding standards such as preferences on indentation and curly braces, coding standards exist for the sole purpose of making your code attractive. If you've ever wrote some code for whatever project, you might feel obligated to think, "Wow, this is beautiful code!" when you finally finish. But is it really beautiful? Maybe. To some software engineers, it might be the absolute worst thing they've read.

<h1>What's so important about coding standards?</h1>
<p>
One important thing about coding standards that I thought I should address is that your code should be able to speak for itself. If you don't have to excessively use comments to explain what's going on, it means that's one less thing you have to read. Understandably, that may depend on the complexity of how its defined, but if what you've wrote is easy to follow, then I don't have to take extra time figuring out how it works. Having code that speaks for itself is a demonstration of your knowledge of fundamentals, from things such as standard formatting to proper naming conventions.
</p>
<p>
Another thing to keep in mind is that coding standards exist to make your life easier, not harder. If following a standard that you know by heart, you should be able to read your code without having to do much tracing. Since it is easier to read, debugging your code should be a lot simpler. This is essential for programmers who work in teams as having a standardized style of writing will allow your team to be able to help each other without having to scratch their head trying to figure out what you were trying to do with your code.

<h1>The Learning Process</h1>
<p>

Let's say you are taking a course working with some new programming language. The first step to understand what is probably going on is to understand the basic structure of how things are done in that language. For example, in ICS 314 Software Engineering, we use the Airbnb coding standards and some of the rules are to avoid the usage of var (<a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#references">Airbnb 2</a>), to such things as substituting the exponential function Math.pow(num, power) to using a ** operator (<a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#es2016-properties--exponentiation-operator">Airbnb 12.3</a>). Learning these types of things will allow you to adhere to the coding standard you are following and allow you to understand what is happening. Eventually you will become proficient enough to understand what is happening in other languages.

<h1>ESLint</h1>

After one week of adapting to ESLint, achieving the green checkmark is nearly no trouble at all. All I really get marked is when to use a const instead of a let, but that's generally because let is easier (for me) to work through things. I am getting better at knowing when to use const before ESLint has to remind me, so I guess ESLint is ever-so-slightly helping me break my bad habits.
</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
After learning more about coding standards, I agree with Philip Johnson that these standards are essential towards learning a new language. To reiterate, coding standards exist to enhance readability and the quality of the code. If you can easily see what's going on in the source code, you can easily spot errors and fix them as needed. I honestly paid no mind to coding standards in the past, but over the years here, I see now why it is so important.
