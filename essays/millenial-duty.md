Technology has always been fascinating to me, primarily because technology had grown at a rapid rate when I was growing up. However, I never thought of working behind the scenes; I was perfectly content with being a consumer. 

Having grown up with technology, I felt like it was my duty as a millennial to be caught up with it. After all, no one in my household can operate a smartphone beyond the dialpad. I knew if I didn’t, I would soon be clueless to something I have always been fond of. So I put myself up to just meeting the bare minimum of what I thought was necessary. It wasn’t long until I wanted to know more, and it wasn’t too long after that I finally found that reason to get into it.

Computer science caught me at a low point in my life: I wasn’t motivated pursuing my degree in accounting. I can honestly say that if anyone suggested anything else to me at that point, I probably would be studying that field today. However, my own interests had taken favor and here I am two years later, writing my first essay ever for an ICS course.

I actually haven’t found a focus in what I want to do, but hopefully by taking this course, I will learn how to properly use the network to my advantage and find something I can be proud to be passionate about.
