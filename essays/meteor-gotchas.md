Whether it be Meteor or any other framework, I would've encountered the same issue regardless. I don't think there are much issues with Meteor itself, but a problem regarding my habits.
</p>
<p>
The biggest problem I've encountered is the transition from my desktop to my laptop and I found out the hard way that I needed to set up my environment properly. I had gone to the WOD a week before writing this essay and although I knew what I was going to do, I hadn't run Meteor on my laptop ever. So I sat there for 15 minutes trying to even get it running in the first place, doing my code on the side just to eventually paste it in when Meteor finally ran. It did not run, and it really hit me that I needed to start working on my laptop if I wanted to pass the class.

<p>
What I had gone through to try solving the problem involved an hour of extensive google searching, hair pulling, cursing at my laptop, which none of those worked. I then contacted Danny since I felt helpless and decided to try running Meteor one more time. Turns out I just needed to actually let it run for a good 20 minutes for the first time and every time after it takes about a minute. It pains me to think that patience was the answer, yet I didn't have any, and this was a huge lesson for me.

Aside from my own personal struggles, I don't think I've come across much other problems besides missing an import statement. As of now the framework is a lot to take in to fully understand, so I guess the other problem at hand, or more like task, is to practice the WODs more than once because I think only by repetitive action and not just rereading will I encounter new problems and comprehension of the framework.
